# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The Changelog starts with v0.4.1, because we did not keep one before that,
and simply didn't have the time to go back and retroactively create one.

## [Unreleased]
### Fixed
- Fixed `shlex.join` use with non-str type objects (e.g. `RemotePath`)
- Fixed `set` command use with incorrect keys (e.g. `set invalid value`)

### Added
- Permission checks on the .ssh directory before adding authkeys, tamper module for reverts.
- Added missed `PlatformError` for `upload` command (e.g. "no gtfobins writers available")

## [0.5.4] - 2022-01-27
Bug fix for the `load` command.

### Changed
- Fixed `Manger.load_modules` call in `pwncat/commands/load.py`.

## [0.5.3] - 2022-01-09
Fix for argument parsing bug introduced in `0.5.2` which caused bind/connect
protocols to be automatically interpreted as SSL even when `--ssl` was not
provided.

### Changed
- Fixed parsing of `--ssl` argument ([#231](https://github.com/calebstewart/pwncat/issues/231)).

## [0.5.2] - 2021-12-31
Bug fixes for argument parsing and improved SSH key support thanks to
`paramiko-ng`. Moved to a prettier theme for ReadTheDocs documentation.

### Changed
- Fixed parsing of `--ssl` argument in main entrypoint ([#225](https://github.com/calebstewart/pwncat/issues/225))
- Replaced `paramiko` with `paramiko-ng`
- Utilized Paramiko SSHClient which will also utilize the SSHAgent if available by default and supports key types aside from RSA ([#91](https://github.com/calebstewart/pwncat/issues/91))
- Added implant module `list` command to match documentation ([#224](https://github.com/calebstewart/pwncat/issues/224)).
- Update documentation to clarify implant reconnection
- Fixed `--ssl` argument parsing for bind channels.
- Moved documentation theme to [furo](https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo).
- Added Extras group for documentation depenedencies and removed `docs/requirements.txt`.

## [0.5.1] - 2021-12-07
Minor bug fixes. Mainly typos from changing the package name.

### Changed
- Fixed `--version` switch.
- Fixed readme typos.
### Added
- Read the Docs Configuration File

## [0.5.0] - 2021-11-28
This is a major release mainly due to the name change, and PyPI package addition.
The package has been renamed to `pwncat-cs` and the default entrypoint has also
been renamed to `pwncat-cs`. These changes were made in an effort to deconflict
with [Cytopia pwncat](https://pwncat.org/). Beyond that, some new features were
added as seen in the release notes below.

I've tried to update all references to the old `pwncat` entrypoint, but may have
missed some throughout the documentation or code. Please open an issue if you
notice any old references to the previous name.

It's worth noting that the internal module name is still `pwncat`, as Cytopia
does not implement an importable package (only a command line entrypoint). I may
change this name in the future, but for now it doesn't cause any issues and would
require a major refactor so I'm going to leave it.

### Changed
- Moved dependency management and building to [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org).
- Changed package name to `pwncat-cs` in order to not conflict w/ cytopia/pwncat.
### Added
- Added `ssl-bind` and `ssl-connect` channel protocols for encrypted shells
- Added `ncat`-style ssl arguments to entrypoint and `connect` command
- Added query-string arguments to connection strings for both the entrypoint
  and the `connect` command.
- Added Enumeration States to allow session-bound enumerations
- Added PyPi publishing to GitHub `publish` workflow.
- Added licensing for pwncat (MIT)
- Added background listener API and commands ([#43](https://github.com/calebstewart/pwncat/issues/43))
- Added Windows privilege escalation via BadPotato plugin ([#106](https://github.com/calebstewart/pwncat/issues/106))
