"""
Channels represent the basic communication object within pwncat. Each channel
abstracts a communication method with a target. By default, pwncat implements
a few standard channels: socket bind/connect and ssh.

A channel largely mimics a standard socket, however exact compatibility with
sockets was not the goal. Instead, it provides a low-level communication channel
between the target and the attacker. Channels make no assumption about protocol
of the C2 connection. This is the platform's job.

As a user, you will never directly create a channel. Instead, you will call
:func:`pwncat.manager.Manager.create_session`. This method will in turn
locate an appropriate channel based on your arguments, and pass all arguments
to the constructor for the appropriate channel type.

    Abstract interation with a remote victim. This class acts similarly to a
    socket object. In the common cases, it simply wraps a socket object. Some
    methods have default implementations, but many are required to be implemented.
    At a minimum, the following methods/properties must be implemented:

    - connected
    - send
    - recv
    - recvinto
    - drain
    - close

    The ``peek`` and ``unrecv`` methods have default implementations which buffer some
    data in memory. If using the default implementations of these methods, you should
    be prepared to read first from `self.peek_buffer` prior to making downstream recv
    requests.

    In general, direct connections are made during ``__init__``. If you are implementing
    a listener, the ``connect`` method can be used to wait for/accept the final
    connection. It is called just before instantiating the resulting pwncat session.
    At all times, ``connected`` should reflect the state of the underlying data channel.
    In the case of listeners, ``connected`` should only be true after ``connect`` is
    called. The ``close`` method should set ``connected`` to false.

    During initialization, you can take any keyword arguments you require to connect.
    However, you should also always accept a ``**kwargs`` argument. Parameters are
    passed dynamically from ``pwncat.channel.create`` and may be attempted with extra
    arguments you don't need.
