=================

``pwncat`` is fully usable without modification, but also provides a scriptable method of interacting
with the remote host. A large variety of interaction with the remote host has been abstracted to
make interaction via python seemless. This is beneficial both for implementing simple ``pwncat``
prompt commands or more complicated privilege escalation or persistence methods.
