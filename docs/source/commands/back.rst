Back
====

The back command is used to exit the local pwncat prompt and return to your remote shell. It is not expected to be
used very often since the ``C-d`` shortcut is the primary method of switching. However, if you need to switch modes from
a script, you can do so with this command. It takes no parameters and will immediately exit the pwncat shell to
return to the remote prompt.
